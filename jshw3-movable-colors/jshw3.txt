1. enter colors, click, boxes show up

take string, make it an array

s= "blue, green, orange"
s.split(', ');
["blue", "green", "orange"]

array.length() => how many times you'll loop, length of the array

use hover ON function, get the background color in css, make input box the same color

do the join thing (?) join => creates a string out of array

split creates array out of string

2. target each box you hover over using THIS
	grab the background-color

	var color = $(this).css('background-color');

	TO GET BACKGROUND COLOR, DON'T GIVE IT A VALUE, IT WILL TELL YOU IT'S VALUE

3. moving stuff around is one line of code	

FIND PREVIOUS ITEM
var.prev()

FIND NEXT ITEM
var.next()

THEN USE "BEFORE" AND "AFTER" LIKE "APPEND" AND "PREPEND"

4. create global variable called  var SELECTED = null;

when you're clicking on this, then 

selected = this THIS LET'S YOU REMEMBER SELECTED ITEM

then you can use the arrow keys 

if this ==selected and you click it, selected = null again

LETS YOU UNCLICK

Give border to SELECTED

At most, one SELECTED

5. DOUBLECLICK REMOVES THE BOX TOO

$(this).remove();
